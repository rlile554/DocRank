### Example locations and practices
As part of the assignment we cleaned a dataset of 5 million medical providers and merged available data online to the dataset.  Because of the size of the data, there is only a portion of it hosted online, so not all zipcodes will have results. Most of the doctors in the hosted database are in the 33606 area code.
